# GNN-PyG
Graph Neural Network model using PyTorch Geometric (PyG)

PyG has provided a much easier way to construct Graph Network. And I am running code on Colaboratory and Kaggle recently, so for more about my recent updates please find me on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/dayuwu/code). I am working on some projects related to financial network and GAN by the way.
